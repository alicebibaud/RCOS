11/01/2020 Submitty

Went through Section Mamager in the instructor module to find bugs.  I did not succeed in breaking it, and instead:

	1)  I found:
		(a) Sections behave as they are meant to.
		(b) When adding sections, vital information appears in a light red box with
		    white text inside - it's hard to read.  I'd like to fix that.

	2)  I did:
		(a) Contacted Jack about the PDF editor - it was an unrelated Open Source
		    project that Submitty absorbed.  No progress to report yet.  
		(b) Nothing relative to the section manager.  Need to talk to Barb about
		    what specifically is going wrong with her specific iteration of it.
