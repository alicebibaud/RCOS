07/23 Status Update - Alice Bibaud

What I did:

	- Went to Bill Ni's workshop on Javascript on Wednesday
	- Worked on a really big project that analyzes Submitty !  Might make a few issues and / or feature
	  requests out of it.  Culter will probably laugh at me, but it will be worth it.
	- Gave up on the Audacity thing.  Realistically, I don't have the time :(
	- Made a Submitty feature request for a Status Update section

Plans for next week:

	- Grade status updates
	- Grade mid-year results
	- Do a mid-year thing

Technical Blockers:
	
	none this week
