06/21 Status Update - Alice Bibaud

What I did:

	- met with electonic music group and discussed a plan of action; oversaw initial development on 06/17
	- posted rcos status update template and example in RCOS chat

Plans for next week:

	- create an instance of any A frame application and try to make some shapes
	- start planning my workshop.

Technical Blockers:
	
	I have a concussion - the hardware I operate out of is not in peak condition.  I will be healing over the
	next week, and hopefully won't have anything more to report on that.
