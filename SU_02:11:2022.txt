02/14/2022 A Series of Small Projects Status Update - Alice Bibaud

What I did:

	- Contacted Eviction Project People about database setup; none of them have gotten back to me tho.
	- Merged some cool stuff that Bill did into the personal website repo repo

	Commits:

	- ^ that merge

Plans for next week:

	- Since setup documentation was written for the existing eviction project repo, somebody converted the 
	  config file from json to python.  I'm emailing the repo owner and asking about that; hopefully, from
	  there, I can
	  
		- finish setting up the database and begin testing / running the application
		- update the documentation

	- If I have time, it might be cute to work on some website stuff with Zack... who's to say

Technical Blockers:
	
	none (yet)
