03/21/2022 A Series of Small Projects Status Update - Alice Bibaud

What I did:

	- Ended Eviction Project.  I couldn't contribute to it with the time and knowledge
	  that I have.  It was stressing me out too much, and I didn't want to let them
	  down
	- Finished the travel portion of website
	- Worked on mobile version of website

	Commits:

	- Worked on mobile version of the website and updated the travel bits

Plans for next week:

	- finish up the website.
		- an interactive resume bit.  my work experience is a lot, and I want
		  people to be able to scroll through and find resources.
		- flesh out the CSS this time.
		- mobile version.

	- Get started on Graf.
		- Think I might start out by converting my PSoft graph representation into
		  javascript, both because I don't want to have to redo the logic and
		  because that will probably help me figure out js a bit better.

	- Go to Paul's Telescope Deep Dive

Technical Blockers:
	
	none (yet)
