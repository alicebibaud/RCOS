11/10 Submitty Status Update - Alice Bibaud

What I did:
I tested out the instructor's window for managing graders; Barb (who has 63 sections, 30+ graders, and 1000+ students) found a bug in the UI that did not enable her to checkthan 1048 boxes in the gigantic grid that she created.  The design apparently does not scale well.

Plans for next week:
Download postgress and learn how to mess with databases.  At least have some ability to do that before next Monday.

Technical Blockers:
Can't find the code for specific issues; I actually suspect it's decently easy to find.  Need to comb through Submitty Deveolpers website and look for more information.

URL's:
I accomplished a test.  I reported my findings in GitHub:
