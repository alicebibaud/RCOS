03/04/2022 A Series of Small Projects Status Update - Alice Bibaud

What I did:

	- Followed up again with Eviction Project Owner; no respose yet.
	- Added an About Page and Cover Page, and finally decided on a format for the rest of the stuff.

	Commits:

	- new branch and refactoring of website.

Plans for next week:

	- finish up the website.
		- an interactive resume bit.  my work experience is a lot, and I want
		  people to be able to scroll through and find resources.
		- make it cute!  gotta flesh out the CSS this time.
		- make a travel bit, because I think that would be cute.

	- Start eviction project implementation without the code base owner.
		- Time to decrypt some funky python files for database information!

Technical Blockers:
	
	none (yet)
