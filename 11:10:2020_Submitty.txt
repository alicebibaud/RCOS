Went through Section Manager in the instructor module to find bugs.  I succeeded in replicating Barb's bug; you cannot select more than 1048 boxes in the Section Manager UI.  It does not scale to the degree that data structures requires, and instead we need to go into the database to fi things.

	1)  I found:
		(a) Sections exceeding 1048+ do not save.  If more are selected, the UI
		    deletes them.
		(b) When adding sections, vital information appears in a light red box
		    with white text inside - it's hard to read.  I'd like to fix that
		    later.

	2)  I did:
		(a) Nothing relative to the section manager.
		(b) I am in the process of learning how to mess around in the database
		    such that I'll know how to save these boxes in the future.
