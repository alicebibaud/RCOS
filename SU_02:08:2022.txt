02/08/2022 A Series of Small Projects Status Update - Alice Bibaud

What I did:

	- Messed around with formatting in the personal website; basically yeeted a lot of the boilerplate stuff
	- turns out the eviction project stuff already exists.  Made an aws account and started setting up the
	  database.

	Commits:

	- SEVERAL commits for reformatting the personal website benji set up

Plans for next week:

	- Since setup documentation was written for the existing eviction project repo, somebody converted the 
	  config file from json to python.  I'm emailing the repo owner and asking about that; hopefully, from
	  there, I can
	  
		- finish setting up the database and begin testing / running the application
		- update the documentation

	- If I have time, it might be cute to work on some website stuff with Zack... who's to say

Technical Blockers:
	
	none (yet)
