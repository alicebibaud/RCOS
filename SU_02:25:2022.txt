02/25/2022 A Series of Small Projects Status Update - Alice Bibaud

What I did:

	- Finally did some website stuff!  Learned a bit of JS, CSS, and HTML on my
	  lonesome.
	- Contacted Eviction Project Owner and followed up; no respose yet.

	Commits:

	- new branch and refactoring of website.

Plans for next week:

	- finish up the website.
		- gotta actually implement the settings page - it's just going to have
		  dark / light mode on it (lower priority)
		- an interactive resume bit.  my work experience is a lot, and I want
		  people to be able to scroll through and find resources.
		- make it cute!  parallax is surprisingly easy, so we're hoping to get on
		  that.

	- Start eviction project implementation without the code base owner.
		- it's been weeks; I can't wait for them to respond anymore.  time to
		  decrypt some funky python files for database information!

Technical Blockers:
	
	none (yet)
