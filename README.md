# RCOS #
This repo stores documentation as to what I've done in the Rensselear Center for Open Source (RCOS).

## Telescope ##
In the Fall of 2022, I got ambitious and decided to try my hand at Rust development for RCOS's website.  So far, we haven't gotten very far, just been trying to coordinate the logistics of how Telescope can be maintained for future semesters.  You can find the repo for Telescope [here] {https://github.com/rcos/Telescope}.

## A Series of Small Projects ##
In the Spring of 2022, I created a personal website to showcase my resume / skills / adventures.  You can find it [here]{https://alicebibaud.github.io/}.  I also contributed to telescope and led the class in my first semester as a coordinator.

Any file committed between 01/01/2022 and 05/30/2022 is part of this project.

## Graf + Submitty ##
In RCOS, I was just a mentor during the 2021 Summer Semester, so I was not part of any official project.  However,
through Software Design and Documentation, I worked on developing new algorithms within Graf and wrote a 30 page
report on the Submitty code base, within which I suggested some new features and discussed their design practices.

Any file committed between 06/21/2021 and 08/20/2021 is part of this project.

- Added DFS, Bellman Ford, and Max Flow algorithms to Graf's implementation
- Graded student status updates and fielded their questions
- Created issues according to my Submitty document

## IBM s390x + LinuxONE ##
This project is an RCOS project hosted by IBM; our goal is to port widely used open source projects to
the s390x architecture used by the IBM Z and LinuxONE machines.

Any file committed between 01/01/2021 and 05/01/2021 is part of this project.

### Contributions ###

## Submitty ##
Submitty is an open source programming assignment submission system from the Rensselaer Center for
Open Source Software (RCOS), launched by the Department of Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute (RPI).
