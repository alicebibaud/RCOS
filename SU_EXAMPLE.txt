03/05 s390x LinuxONE Status Update - Alice Bibaud

What I did:

	- Tried to install OED on RHEL 7.8.  Did not work; we had a lot of trouble with docker-compose.
	- Discovered that docker-compose is not compatible with RHEL 7.8.

	Commits:

	- Committed documentation fix for OED
	- Committed list of Linux distros compatible with docker-compose.

Plans for next week:

	I'd like to Peter and I to find one or two new projects each; that way we can try to make some
	real commits to our original purpose.

Technical Blockers:
	
	Discovered that docker-compose is only compatible with 64 bit operating systems.  I made a big
	angry document about it below in my personal RCOS repo.

	We had no technical blockers that have not since been resolved.
