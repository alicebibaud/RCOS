What I did:

	[all the sick stuff you did this week; go in depth, so the mentors can see that you're making progress]

	Commits:

	[an optional list of the commits + short descriptions of those you made during the week.  doesn't have
	 to be many; maybe just 1 or 0 if you were otherwise busy.  As a mentor, it helps to see a list of these
	 for clarity.]

Plans for next week:

	[short list of next steps you plan to take.  Don't leave this blank! - say you're figuring it out if you
	 don't have a plan yet.]

Technical Blockers:
	
	[short list of next steps you plan to take.  Don't leave this blank! - say you have no technical blockers
	 if that is the case.  Make sure that you resolve these each week as they come up; we don't want you to
	 be stuck on one technical blocker all semester!]
