12/04 Submitty Status Update - Alice Bibaud

What I did:
vagrant destroyed, hunted around for the issue I was assigned.  I'll be honest, this project wasn't really it for me; I needed to not be as intimidated and scared as I am to tackle this, and did not allocate enough time.  However, we persevere!  I am going to commit something by the end of this semester, even if it's just a comment.  I will commit something.

Plans for next week:
Literally just commit something.  Something helpful, that won't break things (like I was somehow able to do with the Google Docs folder with all the notes in it lol).

Technical Blockers:
Mostly my own brain and confidence in my coding ability.  It's cool!

URL's:
I reported my findings in GitHub:
