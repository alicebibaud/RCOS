Went through TA PDF editor and tested functionality to find bugs.

	1)  I found:
		(a) text assigns itself a NULL size, x-coordinate, and y-coordinate in 
		    the document.
		(b) Line objects are primitive: cannot erase portions of objects, cannot
		    use different colors, cannot use different thicknesses.
		(c) Interface is wacky and wild; there's a drag-and-drop window situation
		    going on that isn't ideal.  People are working on this.
		(d) Grading in grading window is not intuitive.

	2)  I did:
		(a) Contacted Jack about the PDF editor - it was built by someone outside
		    of Submitty, and he knew about some things.  Haven't heard back as of 
		    yet.
		(b) Nothing yet, because there are more important issues to deal with
		    here.  We also don't know who built the PDF editor, which this problem
		    is a part of.  If this was Submitty, I'd make some feature requests:
			- Ability to change colors of lines
			- Ability to erase portions of line objects; as you're drawing,
			  could just continuously make "dots", so it appears as a line,
			  and can move like a line (when selected together), but would be
			  erasable in sections rather than as a whole object at once.
		(c) Nothing, because people are working on that now.  Version being worked
		    on will eventually need testing and tweaking.
