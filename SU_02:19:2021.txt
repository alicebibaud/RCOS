02/19 s390x LinuxONE Status Update - Alice Bibaud

What I did:

	- This week, my team and I had proposed that we would decide which repository to work on porting to the s390x architecture.  We chose AIMET, an AI Model Efficiency Toolkit created by the Qualcomm Innovation Center.

	- I got access to the virtual machine to actually start using the IBM mainframes, and have begun going through the documentation to learn how to use it.

	- We met up with our superiors at IBM to check in on our progress - they ok'ed our decision!

	- Read a good chunk of documentation regarding code of conduct with the machines, and how to get started with the VM.

Plans for next week:

	- Simply get into that VM and start working.

		- start figuring out how to test whether or not the program works, and
		- figure out how to port it correctly if not.


Technical Blockers:
