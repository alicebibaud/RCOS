11/20 Submitty Status Update - Alice Bibaud

What I did:
I downloaded some software to look into some database stuff so I would be able to conduct the same tests I did last week in less time.  Unfortunately, the software took up almost all the remaining space on my hard drive, so I haven't done anything with it.

Plans for next week:
learn to use git and figure out where the code is for some Submitty issues.  I actually suspect it's decently easy to find.

Technical Blockers:
I still don't know how to use git.
Morale is low, but I will figure out something before the end of the semester.

URL's:
I reported my findings in GitHub:
