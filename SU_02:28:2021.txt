02/28 s390x LinuxONE Status Update - Alice Bibaud

What I did:

	- This week, my team and I discovered that we could not port Qualcomm's AI Model Efficiency Toolkit
	  because we would need an Nvidia GPU to run it.  We halted progress on that project after
	  attempting to build an instance of AIMET on the linuxONE computers; we could not get around the
	  GPU requirement, though we were able to install Nvidia's docker on VMs running Red Hat 7.8.

	- I got the idea of porting an RCOS project to s390x, so that our open source contributions might
	  be run on big scary IBM mainframes - exciting!  I messaged all the project leads about whether
	  that would be possible, and got many responses.  I chose OED, in part for its practical
	  academic application and in part because of all its documentation.

	- I'm currently attempting a build of OED on the linuxONE VM

Plans for next week:

	- Get into that VM and start working on getting OED running.

		- start figuring out how to test whether or not the program works, and
		- figure out how to port it correctly if not.

	- If not, we should move onto another project.  It's getting late in the semester, so we need to
	  find something FAST.


Technical Blockers:

	Not a technical blocker, but something I'm concerned about:
	
	- This project is one of many commits, but also one of lots of very important communication and
	  managing a lot of moving parts.  I'm concerned that my grade won't reflect the effort I put into
	  this class if I'm scored entirely on commits.
